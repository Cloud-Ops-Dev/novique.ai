Part of my role in IBM Security Operational Services (SOS) included getting customers on-boarded to our SOC. There is a lot that falls under the purview of 'Security Operations', so I decided to look into how AI is improving these critical functions.

## Key Points

- Research suggests AI can significantly enhance SOC functions like monitoring, detection, and response by automating tasks and improving accuracy.
- AI reduces analyst workload, speeds up incident response, and helps detect sophisticated threats.
- The evidence leans toward AI improving threat intelligence and compliance, with examples like anomaly detection in government networks.

## How AI Improves Monitoring

AI automates the analysis of vast data from networks and endpoints, spotting unusual patterns in real time. For instance, it uses machine learning to flag potential issues, like in CISA's system, which processes daily network logs to highlight anomalies for analysts to review.

## Enhancing Threat Detection and Response

AI helps detect complex threats, such as advanced phishing, by analyzing behavior and historical data, reducing false alarms. It also speeds up responses by automatically isolating compromised systems or blocking threats.

## Supporting Threat Intelligence and Compliance

AI processes threat data to predict attacks and automates compliance checks, ensuring systems meet regulations. For example, CISA uses AI to score threat indicators, prioritizing critical alerts.

## Conclusion

AI is revolutionizing SOCs by automating routine tasks, enhancing threat detection accuracy, and enabling proactive defense measures. Examples from CISA, Palo Alto Networks, Exabeam, and Secureworks demonstrate its impact, reducing analyst burnout and strengthening security posture.
