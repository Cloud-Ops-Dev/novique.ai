Welcome to Novique.AI, where cutting-edge AI meets the everyday hustle of small and medium-sized businesses!

I'm Mark Howell, the Chief Technology Officer and the guy who's basically traded in my corporate suit for a superhero cape *(okay, it's more like a comfy hoodie, but you get the idea).*


After spending the last 10 years at IBM, diving deep into complex tech challenges for Fortune 500 giants, I hit what I like to call my "inflection point"—you know, that moment when you realize your work is solving big problems for big companies, but maybe not making the dent in the world you dreamed of.

Picture this: me, pacing my office, pondering life's mysteries over a lukewarm coffee. That's when I started chatting with some trusted friends and industry leaders who nodded vigorously and said, "Mark, why not flip the script?"

And flip it I did! I envisioned a world where powerhouse AI solutions aren't just for the NASDAQ elite with seven-figure IT budgets. Nope—modern AI can be engineered to be both ridiculously cost-effective and downright game-changing for the rest of us: the mom-and-pop shops, the local innovators, and the ambitious startups ready to level up.

That's the spark that ignited Novique.AI. We're here to democratize AI, turning "what if" ideas into "wow, that works!" realities for businesses like yours.

Whether you're looking to streamline operations, supercharge customer insights, or just outsmart your competition without breaking the bank, we've got your back. Let's chat about how we can tailor AI magic to your unique needs—because every business deserves a shot at the big leagues!
