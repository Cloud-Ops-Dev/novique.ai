As a small business owner, you've likely heard about AI transforming industries. But between the technical jargon, high costs, and complexity, it can feel out of reach.

That's where Novique comes in. We believe small businesses deserve the same advantages that large enterprises have - intelligent automation, data insights, and efficiency - without needing a tech team or breaking the bank.

## The Problem We're Solving

Small businesses face unique challenges:

- Limited time and resources to research and implement new technology
- No dedicated IT staff to manage complex systems
